        height: 240px;

        3 : 4 = 180 : 240
        Solution:

        Since
        3 : 4 = X : 240

        Then we know
        3/4 = X/240

        Multiplying both sides by 240 cancels on the right
        240 × (3/4) = (X/240) × 240
        240/ × (3/4) = X

        Then solving for X
        X = 240 × (3/4)
        X = 180

        Therefore
        3 : 4 = 180 : 240

        Padding for others
        Width of image is 120px.
        Div is 180px.
        180-120=60
        60/2=30
        30px on each side.

        Trying (#)9CEC2D (outline) - works as a colour but not witht he original green. 85 degrees on the hue worked though too with no other changes, seems like it'd work rather. Didn't implement. 22:45(pm) index12-1 16/Feb/22.

        ( ((61/100)*255) *1.25 )/255 *100= 76.25
        B5EC2D. Before putting in, it seems too bright.
        83C525 this is the one it should be and actually seems to work. Something, I think the hue got changed and was then being edited witht eh layers of iteration on top.

            Added 'em' to the font family css and it still needs to be smaller and slightly "brighter" so darker if that makes sense. Brighter and lighter aren't the same in this context if that makes sense. Needs more contrast. Odd wording (for and to get to that). [22:01(pm) index10 16/Feb/22.]
            (#)cacaca at font size 17(px). Feels like it should be lighter and smaller.

            #cfcfcf. Could be lighter.
            dddddd - needs to be a bit darker.
